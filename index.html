You copied the XLM address and pasted it in your wallet when you were trying to send XLM, but you did not copy the memo tag from that same Coinspot page with the XLM address, and did not paste it in the memo tag field in the wallet application. You then continued and sent over XLM to your Coinpot address without a memo tag, resulting in not receiving the XLM you’ve sent to your Coinspot account.<br><br>Your best option to possibly fix this issue, and recover your XLM funds, is to contact Coinspot support and mention this issue to them, and hopefully they’d be to help you recover your lost XLM, but there is a possibility that they can’t cover them.<br>I hope I was able to help you understand what happened.<br></p>

Meaning that those who have NEO in their wallet, would have 1, 24 or 483 for example, but they cannot have 0.4, 4.7, 295.1 for example.<br><br>Now you would probably be wondering “If that’s the case, how can I see that I have 1.73 NEO in my Binance account?”<br>That’s because exchanges like Binance have the ability to add decimals to a coin like NEO, so long as they buying and selling is occurring within the exchange, within the Binance platform.<br><br>So when you sent out 1.73 NEO, it actually sent out 1 NEO.<br><br>A compromise solution would be to sell 0.73 NEO that you have on Binance for a different cryptocurrency, like ETH for example, in which case you’d be able to withdraw the full amount of ETH to your wallet (after Binance takes a fee from it).<br>I hope I was able to help you understand what happened.<br></p>

There may be other possibilities as to why this is occurring, perhaps it’s an issue with Coinbase itself, or his wallet app isn’t working properly for some reason. As such, I’d have to inquire for more information.<br><br>-My reply to the customer:<br>Hey Bob,<br><br>I can’t make use of your Coinbase account to help you properly unfortunately.<br><br>We looked into Coinbase’s help center to see if there’s anything related to your issue, and we found this piece of question-and-answer post that might help you understand what’s happening:<br><br>“Why is my cryptocurrency send delayed?”<br>https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/sending-or-receiving-cryptocurrency/why-is-my-cryptocurrency-withdrawal-delayed.html<br><br>Aside from that, there’s two possible reasons as to why you’re facing this issue:<br><br>When you were on the Coinbase withdrawal page, you may have made an error/typo when writing down your BTC address, in which case what you sent would be lost and cannot be recovered.You didn’t make an error when typing your address. Coinbase may have faced an issue on their end, to which point you’d need to contact their support about this issue.<br><br>Either way, for me to be able to help you further, I would need more information from.You could send me the transaction ID that was generated when you sent out BTC from Coinbase to your wallet, and your BTC public address (from your wallet) that you used to receive BTC from Coinbase, alongside providing the amount of BTC you sent.<br><br>I’m requesting these to help you confirm that you sent BTC to the correct address, and to see what the state of the transaction is.<br><br>If you do not wish to send the above information, but instead you would rather have me write to you a step by step guide, then I’ll gladly do so.<br></p>

This usually means that the user have made an error in either typing down the words into the wallet, where their 12 world mnemonic phrase was recorded correctly in the past, or they’ve made a mistake in the initial recording of those words when they’ve created a wallet, in which case they’d obviously type down a wrong 12 world mnemonic phrase into the wallet to try and restore it.<br>Note to reader: I don’t read, write or comprehend the Russian language. I’ve run the question into Google translate to understand the question.<br><br>-My reply to the customer:<br>Hey USER,<br><br>It seems like you are trying to restore your wallet. The issue you are facing is a result of not typing your 12 word seed phrase correctly.<br>Make sure that the 12 words, the ones that you should have properly backed up, saved and secured when you created your wallet, are typed in correctly when trying to restore your wallet.<br><br>If you are still getting that error, after making sure that you’ve typed it in correctly, then you may have written down your 12 word seed phrase incorrectly, when you first created your wallet. In this case, you can head over to the list of words (2048 words) that was used to provide you with your 12 word seed phrase:<br><br>https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/english.txt<br><br>Search for each of your words on that list, compare how they are written, between that page that has all those 2048 words and your own 12 word seed phrase, to find all the words that you might have mistakenly written incorrectly.<br><br>Also, please make sure you are taking high safety measures while doing this process, like doing it while not connecting to the internet, in the privacy of your own home, and where no one is near your, or any devices with a camera or microphone is present.<br><br>Hopefully you will find the mistake, type it in correctly and be able to restore your wallet.<br></p>

If you were using a different wallet, you would have seen the same amount of fees that you have to pay.<br><br>There will always be a fee associated with any transaction you will conduct with BTC, where the fee might be very low, or very high, depending on the state of the Bitcoin network.<br><br>Now, there’s two options that you can choose to do to help you solve this issue:<br><br>Wait it out until the fee, to send BTC from one address to another, decreases. Or.. use the wallet’s feature that allows you to set up a custom fee rate, to decrease the amount that you have to pay for the fee. Although be careful with this, as you might be waiting for horse, days, weeks or more before your transaction, of sending BTC from your address to another, is successful, where there’d also be a possibility that it may get canceled, and the funds get reverted back to you, after waiting that long period of time.<br><br>You can read more about custom fees and how to enable and set one up, by reading up on it, from our knowledge base:<br><br>LINK<br><br>I hope I was able to help you understand what happened, and to have aided you in resolving this issue.<br></p>

Losing those words means that you lost your wallet forever.<br><br>The only way for you to recover your wallet, is if you’ve remember how and where you’ve backed-up / saved your 12 word seed phrase, at which point, when you launch the wallet software on your computer, there’s a ‘Restore’ button located at bottom-middle of the window, below the password field, click that and you’d be directed to type in your 12 word seed phrase.
